# KiCAD footprint collection [![][travis-svg]][travis]
This is a collection of all the KiCAD footprints I know of. If you know of any more, please let me know!
All the official libraries are included in the `KiCad/` sub-directory.

These are fairly regularily checked with [Travis CI][travis] to make sure KiCAD can load them.

Personally I use this with the footprint search that has been merged into the development (master) branch of KiCAD.

This repo uses git submodules.
A submodule is a way of including another git repo in your repo holding it at a particular version until you want to update it.
This is useful as you can easily keep a local copy of all the libraries, freeze them and only update when you want to.

## Usage

### Initialization


    git clone --branch stable https://github.com/monostable/kicad_footprints
    cd kicad_footprints && ./init

This downloads all the libraries in parallel but it can still take a while.

If you use a KiCAD nightly or development version you will get a few more footprints if you switch to the master branch:

    git checkout master && ./init

### Updating

If you want to update all libraries to their latest versions do:

    ./update

_Warning: `./update` will [`git reset --hard`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man1/git-reset.1.html) the submodules so don't make changes in these folders that you want to keep. Make a separate clone of the submodule respository for that._

If you want to pull in any libraries that have been added since your initial clone:

    git pull && ./init

### Registering with KiCAD

You can add these libraries manually through the KiCAD GUI of course. 
You could also use `generate_table` to generate an fp-lib-table, the file KiCAD uses as a footprint registry, with all the footprints from this repository.
You could use this to replace your existing fp-lib-table.
You will need to restart KiCAD for this change to take effect.

#### Linux

    cp ~/.config/kicad/fp-lib-table ~/.config/kicad/fp-lib-table.backup
    ./generate_table ~/.config/kicad/fp-lib-table

#### Mac OS

    cp ~/Library/Preferences/kicad/fp-lib-table ~/Library/Preferences/kicad/fp-lib-table.backup
    ./generate_table ~/Library/Preferences/kicad/fp-lib-table

#### Windows (using git-bash)

    cp ~/AppData/Roaming/kicad/fp-lib-table ~/AppData/Roaming/kicad/fp-lib-table.backup
    ./generate_table ~/AppData/Roaming/kicad/fp-lib-table

### Adding submodules

If you know of any KiCAD footprint repositories that have not been added please [file an issue](https://github.com/monostable/kicad_footprints/issues) and I will add them.

If you want to maintain a private fork of this repository with some private submodules you can add them simply by:

```
git submodule add <git url> <folder>
git commit
```

They should work fine with the rest of the scripts once they are added.

Any scripts in this repository are MIT licensed. All the footprints have their own licenses of course.
